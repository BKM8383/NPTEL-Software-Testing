# Mutation testing grammars and inputs  
* BNF grammars used to define syntax for input of a program or method  
* Regular expression may not be enough to express large set so use BNF  
* Tests are input strings derived from the grammar  
* Strings are derived by applying production rules to replace non terminals with other strings, stop when string of terminals obtained  
* If grammar not available, derive grammar from informal description  
* XML is an input format extensible markup language  
* Describes structured inputs and is used with web apps  
* built in syntax to describe inputs are called schemas  
* XML tages are in <>  
* XML messages must have a single document element with proper tages and proper nesting  
* ex: <book>  
        <title> hello </title>  
      </book>  
* Tester should also give malformed or invalid inputs to see if it is rejected  
* Input grammars can be mutated to generate invalid inputs  
* When mutating grammars, mutants are the test cases themselves so no ground string, or killing of mutants  
* Mutating grammars  
  * Non terminal replacement: every non terminal in production is replaced with another non terminal  
  * Terminal replacement: every terminal symbol in a production is replaced by other terminals  
  * Terminal and non terminal deletion: Every terminal and non terminal in a production is deleted  
  * Terminal and non terminal duplication; every terminal and non terminal is duplicated one at a time  
    
* Above operators can also be used in XML  
* Mutations when applied to program result in programs which can be killed by test inputs, mutation applied to inputs directly produces test inputs
