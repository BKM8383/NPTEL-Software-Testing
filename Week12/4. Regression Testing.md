# Regression Testing  
* Regression testing is validating modified software to detect if new errors have been introduced into code that was previously tested  
* It is a black box technique and is expensive  
* After release, software maintained by developers and during maintenance, modifications done to code  
* Let P be a program and P' is the modified program. T is test suite for P. steps of regression test  
  1. Select T' which is a subset of T for P'  
  2. Test P' with T'  
  3. If needed create new test cases T'' for P'   
  4. Test P' with T"  
  5. P' is the new version and P is not kept so keep new test suite from T,T',T" for P'  
* Step 1 deals with regression test selection  
* Step 3 deals with coverage identification problem  
* Step 2 and 4 address test suite execution problem (problem of efficiently executing test cases and checking results)  
* Step 5: test suite maintenance  
* Regression test selection is applicable when specifications have changed and when they have not changed  
* If specifications have changed, then find out which test cases are obselete for P'. These can be removed and regression testing done on remaining test cases  
* Obselete for p' if the test case specifies an input to p' that is invalid for p'
* Test selection requires domain specific knowledge, selected based on area of frequent faults, include area where many changes made, based on criticality  
* Test selection techniques  
  * Minimization test selection techniques: T' is as minimal as possible. it is undecidable.  
  * Data flow coverage based regression test selection: select cases that test interactions that have been modified. every def use pair in P' that is new or deleted from P or modified is tested.  
  * technique is not safe if it fails to select a tes t case that would have revealed a fault  
    * If safety conditions explicitly mentioned can be satisfied, then safe regression test selection guarantees that T' contains all test cases in T that reveal faults in P'  
  * Random test selection: randomly select test cases and is often useless  
  * Retest all uses all T to test P', but some new test cases may be needed.
* Different test selection techniques create trade offs between costs of selecting and executing and detecting faults  
* Choice if test selection technique affects how cost effective regression testing is  
* Heavily automated, regression tools are record and playback type. test case recorded by navigating through the program under test and verified by checking results
