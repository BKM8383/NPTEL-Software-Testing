#  Testing Mobile Applications  
* Mobile application testing is testing of software meant to run only on handheld devices  
* Usability very important and it should be consistent accross all platforms  
* Can be automated or manual  
* Apps are either pre installed or installed using distribution platforms  
* Testing of wearable applications is also related (watch apps)  
* Challenges:  
  * Wide range of OS and platforms - Device fragmentation  
  * Multiple devices must also be used to test  
  * Different screen sizes and hardware devices, cannot buy each phone  
  * Large number of network providers (above 400) and some use common standards such as GSM but some use less common standards and different infrastruture  
  * Executing a test script across devices is challenging since devices differ in input methods, and single script ccannot work in all devices  
  * Mobile apps need to be tested for downloadability srom a particular store  
  * Compatibility across devices and platforms is important  
* mobile vs desktop  
  * Desktop, application tested on cbu but for mobile tested on mobile handset  
  * Mobile screen size and memory less than desktop  
  * Mobiles use cellular or wifi but desktop uses onlu broadband or dial up  
  * test script can be used for desktop but not for mobiles  
* TYpes of mobile app testing  
  * FUnctional testing: ensures app meets requirements and are conducted using UI and call flow  
  * Usability testing: checks if good UI experience and easy to use. Tests accross devices and sizing  
  * Performance testing: checks performance under certain conditions. ex low memory low battery bad network. it is done on client and server side  
  * Compatibility testing: Testing on different browsers, diff devices, diff OS, resolution  
  * Memory related testing: ensures that appl manages memory and doesnt slow down device. Memory constraing should be there and temp files should be deleted  
  * Installation testing: Some are pre installed and some have to be downloaded. this testing covers updating and installation  
  * Interrupt testing: Application might face interrupts such as incoming call, sms, removed battery, charge phone, so check if goes to correct state and then resumes  
  * Security testing: apps used for bank transactions so check for vulnerabilities related to hacking, access control. There are standards that need to be met  
  * Location testing: connectivity changes with location so must check app functionality after these changes but difficult to mimic different locations  
    
* Emulators used to test system level features  
* Emulator is a software that runs a software from one environment fom another without changing software. duplicates features of real system  
* 3 emulators  
  * Device emulator provided by device manufacturer  
  * Browser emulator: simulates mobile browser  
  * OS emulator: provided by OS firm
