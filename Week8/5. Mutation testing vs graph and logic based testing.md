#  Mutation testing vs graph and logic based testing  
* Mutation is the strongest test criteria so subsumes a good amount of other criteria  
* Mutation operators can be picked such that it subsumes particular coverage criterias  
* Mutation operators that ensura coverage of a criteria are said to yield the criteria  
* Typical coverage criteria impose a local requirement, every branch is to be executed. doesnt talk about inputs  
* Mutation tetsing imposes a global requirement, incorrect output must be produced
* Mutation testing has stronger requiremenets that other coverage criteria  
* Weak mutation: mutations not equal at infection but equal at propogation stage  
* Mutation testing subsumes node coverage. Draw cfg of the program and to target a particular node, add a bomb there and test case visits the bomb statement  
* Mutation testing subsumes edge coverage because mutation operator to be applied to subsume edge coverage is to replace logical predicate with true and false  
* Test case must take false branch to kill true mutant and take true branch to kill false mutant  
* Mutation testing does not subsume prime path coverage etc  
* Mutation coverage subsumes predicate coverage since it is the same as edge coverage  

* Mutation testing also subsumes clause coverage and not combinatorial coverage  
* Clause coverage:each clause must be tested to be true and flase. Relational, conditional and logical operator replacement will make each clause in each predicate true and false  
* To kill true mutant test case must cause clause and predicate to be false and to kill a false mutant, test case must cause clause and predicate to be true   
* For example if a mutant for a^b is a^true, then in the test case b is false to kill the mutant  
  
* Mutation testing subsumes GACC, but not CACC and RACC  
* Only 1 mutation operator at a time so no CACC and RACC  
  
* Mutation testing subsumes all-defs  
* Mutation applied is to delete all variable definitons
