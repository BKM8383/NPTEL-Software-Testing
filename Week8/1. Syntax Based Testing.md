# Syntax Based Tasting  
* Syntax can be used to generate artifacts that are valid and invalid. These artifacts are sometimes test cases, but are mostly used to generate test cases  
* * Syntax comes in 3 levels  
   * Words: the lexical level, specified using regular expressions. defines how characters form tokens  
   * Phrases: Grammar level, determines how tokens form phrases. Specified usimg CFG in Backus Naur Form BNF  
   * Context: Types of variables, what the refer to. Specified using context sensitive grammar  
* Semantics associate a language with regex  
* L(r+r')=L(r)UL(r')  
* L(r*)=L(r)*  
* L(r.r')=L(r).L(r')  
* CFG is of the form G=(N,A,S,P) where N-non terminals, A-terminals, S belongs to N and is start non-terminal, P is productions)
* Lexical analyzer parses a regular expression  
* Sentential Form of Grammar G: any alpha belonging to (N U A)* such that S derives alpha in any number of steps (Intermediate RHS of derivations)  
* A Language is a context free language if there is a context free grammar which has the same language  

* Coverage Criteria over grammars:  
  * Terminal Symbol Coverage (TSC):TR contains each terminal symbol in the grammar  
  * Production Coverage (PC): TR contains each production  
  * Derivation Coverage (DC): TR contains every possible string that can be derived from the grammar. Can be infeasible if language is infinite  
    
* PC subsumes TSC  
* DC is infeasible
