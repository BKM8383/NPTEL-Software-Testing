# Mutation Testing  
* Mutation involves making syntactically valid changes and then testing  
* Grammars generate valid strings. Derivations in grammar also used to generate invalid strings  
* Testng based on the valid and invalid strings is mutation testing  
* Can be applied to code, design, inputs, requirements  
  
* Ground String: A string in the grammar  
* Mutation Operator: Rule that specifies syntactic variations of strings generated from a grammar  
* Mutant: Result of 1 application of a mutation operator  
  
* Ground string could be a program specified using a grammar (ex java)  
* Mutation operator can be applied to grammar or dynamically derived during derivation  
* Sometimes when we mutate inputs, program stays the same and only program outputs are checked so after applying mutation operator we still get ground string  
* Ideally use only 1 mutation operator and after analyzing it use another so that it is easier to track  
* If the program is small, then every possible application of a mutation operator to a ground string should be consudered. Not for large  
* Mutation operators have been designed for several programming languages, modelling languages, data definition languages etx  
* Mutation operators for programming languages can be applied at unit testing and integration testing levels  
  
* Let M be the set of mutants. Each mutant m in M leads to a different test requirement  
* Testing goal is to kill mutatt by causing mutant to produce different output  
* Given a mutant m in M for a derivation D and a test t, t kills m iff the output of t on D is different from output of t on m  
   
* Coverage Criteria  
  * **Mutation Coverage**: For each mutatnt m in M, TR contains exactly one requirement to kill m  
    * amount of coverage is written as percent of killed mutants and is **mutation score**  
    * high mutation score does not mean better testing  
  * When grammar is mutated to produce invalid strings, run mutants and check if correct behavior  
  * **Mutation Operator Coverage**: For each mutation operator, TR contains one requirement to create a mutated string m that is derived using the mutation operator  
  * **Mutation Production Coverage**: For each mutation operator, and each production the operator can be applied to, TR contains one requirement to create a mutated string from that production  
    
* Mutation testing is very difficult to apply by hand
