# Mutation Testing for programs  
* program based mutation: begin with program which is ground string, apply 1 or more mutation operators to get mutant. mutant must compile. mutant is not a test, must write test which can kill mutant  
* delta 1 means 1 mutation applied  
* Variable reference mutant: replaces one variable with another  
* Mutant can change a relational operator  
* Bomb() is a special mutation operator that causes run time failure as soon as it is reached. Useful for random crash testing  
* failOnZero() is a special mutation operator that causes a failure if the parameter is 0 and does nothing if it is not 0  
* Exhaustive muation operators available. Must be selected carefully to strengthen quality of testing.  
* Test case is effective if different behavior form original program  
* Mutation operators mimic programmer mistakes
  
* Variants of mutants  
  * **Stillborn Mutant**: Mutant of program result in invalid programs that cant be compiled  
  * **Trivial mutant**: Mutant can be killed by almost any test case. not useful  
  * **Equivalent mutant**: Functionally equal to given program, cannot be killed  
  * **Dead Mutant**: Valid and can be killed by a test case. Useful for mutation testing  
    
* Killing a mutant:  May not be necessary to see change through output only, reachability and infection enough, propogation not needed  
* **Strongly Killing mutant**: output of test case on program is different from output of test case on mutant  
* **Strong Mutation Coverage**: TR contains one requirement to strongly kill every mutant m in M  
* **Weakly Killing mutant**: test case weakly kills a mutant m if the state of execution of P on t is different from state of execution of m immediately after l where l is the location that the mutant modified  
* **Weak Mutation Coverage**: TR contains one requirement to weakly kill every mutant m in M  
  
* mutation testing process  
  * Take the input tes program  
  * Create mutants using available mutation operators  
  * If mutant equals original so waste, use equivalence heuristic to check  
  * Generate test cases  
  * Run T on P and m  
  * Eliminate ineffective test cases and check if threshold reached  
  * If threshold not reached generate more test cases  
  * otherwise If program is not correct fix it
