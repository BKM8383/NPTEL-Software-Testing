* DART is a concolic testing tool  
* It applies to unit testing phase  
* DART does symbolic and concrete execution  
* DART can explore all paths when feasible  
* DART can automate unit testing  
&nbsp;
* DART automatically extracts the interface of a program using static source code parsing  
* DART generates a test driver which can give random inputs to the program  
* As the program executes, DART collects some information and generates new inputs through dynamic analysis  &nbsp;
&nbsp;
* DART elmiinated the need to write a test driver as it does it automatically  
* DART can detect standard errors  
* Sometimes through random testing it is unlikely to satisfy the conditions for an error to be produced  
* Dart can do inter procedural dynamic tracing: ex: `if f(x)==5 where function f returns 2*x, DART will replace f(x) by 2*x `  
&nbsp; 
* DART does directed search by starting with the random input, checks the PC, and if some predicate was made true, it will now be made false and values are generated by the constraint solver so that other paths can be explored  
&nbsp;
* DART stops on identifying an error  
* Execution model of DART helps execute normally and symbolically(collects path constraints)  
&nbsp;
* Symbolic representation of a variable is its memory address  
* Memory M is a mapping from address locations m to words which are the actual contents  
* M'=M + `[ m |-> v]` Memory M is updated and only value of address m changes to v  
* Symbolic variables are identified by addresses  
* m can denote the memory address or the variable identified by address m  
* symbolic expression is a logical expression with symbolic variables and constants  
  * `examples: *(e,e') is multiplication, <=(e,e'), negation, *e' is pointer dereference, etc`  
&nbsp;
* Semantics of programs must be defined at memory level  
* Statements are machine instructions at the level of memory  
* Statement labels are denoted by instruction addresses  
* special statements used in programs are abort: program error and halt: normal program termination  
&nbsp;  
* a special function at(l,M) gives address of next instruction  
* evaluate-concrete(e,M) evaluates expression e using values in memory M and gives a value for e  
* Inputs to dart are memory locations corresponding to symbolic variables  
* input vector assigns an input value to each parameter and defines the initial value of memory M  
* A - assignment statements, C - Conditional statements  
* program execution w is the following regex `Execs=(AUC)*(abort|halt)`
