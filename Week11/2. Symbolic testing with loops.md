* Path constraint for a loop is a sequence of trues followed by a false which is for when it terminates  
* Symbolic execution may result in an infitinite number of paths so have a timeout for time or number of iterations  
* If the PC generated contains formulas that cannot be solved by a constraint solver, symbolic execution cannot generate inputs and this is a disadvantage  
* Some functions may be used for which code is not available so this is another disadvantage  
* Real life programs have many paths so many path constraints and exploring all paths may not be feasible  
  
* DART overcomes disadvantages of symbolic testing  
* DART - Directed automated random testing or concolic testing  
* It performs symbolic testing dynamically  
* It is a combination of concrete and symbolic  
* Concolic testing generates a random input for the program and collects symbolic PC along the execution  
* CUTE,PEX,SAGE are popular constraint solver tools
