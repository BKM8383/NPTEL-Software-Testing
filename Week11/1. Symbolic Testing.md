# Symbolic Testing  
* Program proving: Any input is given and programs execute correctly. Involve formal methods  
* Program testing: only a set of testcases are used
* Program can never be proved to be correct as we cannot exhuastively test usng all possible inputs. w can only claim program works right for the inputs we have tested. no claims about test cases we have not used.  
* Formal methods are mathematical techniques based on deriving formal models from program. Formal models include model checking, theorem proving, program analysis   
* Program is not even executed in program proving and program is just proved to meet specification  
* Not all proofs can be automated  
* Symbolic execution is in between proving and testing. It executes a program symbolically for a set of inputs  
* Each symbolic execution is equal to a large number of normal test cases  
* Symbolic values ex: alpha1 is a placeholder for a concrete value (can be thought of as a variable)  
* PC - path constraint : conditions that collect predicates related to RIPR (marked as true if it is reachable)  
* Symbolic execution tree: Has conditional statements and test case which make the condition true and false  
* Variables are in terms of symbolic values as symbolic expressions  
* Symbolic state (sigma): symbolic expressions for each variable at a point of time  
* Symbolic path constraint: predicate formula to reach a statement  
* Symbolic execution generates test input for each execution path of a program  
* Execution path is a sequence of true and false where true/false at the ith position in the sequence denotes that the ith conditional statement in the path took the then(for true) and else (for false)  
* symbolic state (sigma) is initially empty  
* At a read statement (for example parameter passing to the function) symbolic values are assigned to each variable and the mapping is added to sigma  
* At an assignment statement v=e, symbolic expressions are assigned. Sigma is updated by mapping variable v to sigma(e), which is obtained by evaluating e in the current symbolic state
* PC is initialized to true at the beginning of symbolic execution  
* At a conditional statement if(E) then .. else .., PC is PC ^ sigma(e) for then branch and PC ^ !sigma(e) for the else branch  
* Each path constraint (predicate formula) is solved to find a suitable assignment of concrete to symbolic values and if it is satisfiable then symbolic exec continues. Otherwise, it terminates. It can also terminate if an exit statement is reached or error occurs.  
* At the end of symbolic execution, PC is solved using constraint solver. If concrete values are obtained then those are test inputs  
* When the concrete obtained are used to test, all execution paths are tested
