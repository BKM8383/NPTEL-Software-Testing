#### DART for C inteface extraction  
* DART identifies external interfaces thoguh which program obtains inputs via uninitialized memory locations  
* In C, external interfaces are external variables and external functions, arguments of the top level function which is called to start execution  
* Inputs to the C program are defined as memory locations dynamically initialized at runtime through the static external interface  
* Mapping inputs to memory:  
  * Multiple inputs can be mapped to an address m and these are obtained by successively reading m during successive calls to the top level function  
  * Same input can be mapped to dif addresses in diff execution  
* For each external interface, determine the type of input that can be passed to the program via that interface  
&nbsp;  
* 3 different kinds of functions  
  * Program functions: functions defined in the program  
  * External functions: functions controlled by the environment and hence part of external interface of the program. non-deterministically return any value of their return type  
  * Library functions: not defined in the program but controlled by the program

#### DART for C random test driver  
* main function of test driver initializes all external variables and args of the top level function with random values  
* number of times that the top level function needs to be called iteratively in a single run is specified by the tester  
* driver also has code simulating external functions such that whenever an external funcion is called, random valye of the functions return type is returned by the simulated function  
* once the test driver has been generated, it can be combined with the C program being tested to form a self executabl program

#### DART for C implementation of directed search  
* Symbolic calc is performed using CIL, a OCAML appl for parsing and analyzing C code  
* DART uses constraint solver IP_Solve to solve linear constraint using real and integer programming techniques
