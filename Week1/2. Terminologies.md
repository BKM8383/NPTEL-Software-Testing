* Validation: evaluation at the end of development  
* Verification: during software development  
* Testing mainly deals with verification  
* Formal methods: model checking, theorem proving, program abalysis  
* Accreditation: safety critical software  
* Fault: defect that occurs in software, not when software is executing  
* Failure: The incorrect behavior when software is executing which is due to a fault in the code  
* Error: incorrect state that a software enters because of a fault  
* bug and fault was used by edison  
* error was used by ada lovelace  
* Test case: involves inputs to software and expects outputs  
* If actual output matches expected output, then test cases passed. Otherwise failed  
* Failed test case indicates error  
* test case has id, and traceability details that tell what functionality is being tested by the test case  
* Traceability data is stored in a traceability matrix  
* Various levels of testing:  
  * UNit testing: by developer during coding  
  * Integration: Various components put together and tested (HW or SW component)  
  * System testing: Full system implementation and platform where system will run (ex: with db, clients, server). It is an end to end testing  
  * Acceptance testing: Done by end customer to make sure it meets requirements  
  * Beta testing is done in beta version of software (not fully tested yet)  
  * Functional testing: checks if software meets specified functionality  
  * Stress testing: peak conditions tested (10000 users)  
  * Performance testing: speed and response  
  * Usability testing: UI testing  
  * Regression Testing: Done after modifying one component and checks if others are not damaged  
    
* 2 broad methods of testing:  
  * Black box testing: Test without looking at internal code  
  * White box testing: Tests internal structure and code (unit, integration, system)  
    
* Activities in testing:  
  1. Define and design test case  
  2. Test automation is making is execution ready  
  3. Test execution
  4. Evaluation analysis: check if passed and if not where there is an error  
Adjacent activities are test management, maintenance and documentation  
  
Test design is the most critical job. Effective test cases must be designed. Inputs and expected outputs are defined. Domain knowledge is needed so it cannot be automated.  
jUnit is used to convert test cases to executable scripts
