# Test automation  
* Ensuring RIPR are done in the step of automation  
* Prefix are given towards reachability  and postfix to ensure propogation  
* Test automation controls execution of tests and compares actual and expected output. Preconditions are set up  
* Prefix values are inputs needed to put software into the correct state where it can receive actual test cases.  
* Postfix values: value sneeded to that output of tests can reach the output of software.  
  * Verificatioin values are needed to see the results of test case values  
  * Exit values are needed to terminate the program or go to a stable state  
* Test case has test case values, prefix, postfix, expected outputs  
* Executable test script is now needed and it contains the above values  
* JUnit is open source and is used for test automation  
* Results can also be evaluated using junit  
JUnit features
* Assertions always return true or false  
* Common test data can be shared between people  
* GUI and textual interface  
* Test suites for organizing and running test cases
