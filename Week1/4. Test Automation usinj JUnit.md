# Test automation  
* Ensuring RIPR are done in the step of automation  
* Prefix are given towards reachability  and postfix to ensure propogation  
* Test automation controls execution of tests and compares actual and expected output. Preconditions are set up  
* Prefix values are inputs needed to put software into the correct state where it can receive actual test cases.  
* Postfix values: value sneeded to that output of tests can reach the output of software.  
  * Verificatioin values are needed to see the results of test case values  
  * Exit values are needed to terminate the program or go to a stable state  
* Test case has test case values, prefix, postfix, expected outputs  
* Executable test script is now needed and it contains the above values  
* JUnit is open source and is used for test automation  
* Results can also be evaluated using junit  
JUnit features
* Assertions always return true or false  
* Common test data can be shared between people  
* GUI and textual interface  
* Test suites for organizing and running test cases  

* JUnit mainly for testing java programs  
* JUnit used for unit and integration testing but not for system  
* Can test an entire object or part of an object or interaction between objects  
* Each tets is embedded into a test method  
* Test class contains 1 or more tets methods  
* Methods to set up state before and update after each test are included in test class  
  
* **junit.framework.assert class must be used.**  
* test runner method uses result of assert.  
* assertTrue(boolean) if boolean predicate is true then true
* assertTrue(string,boolean) if boolean predicate is false print string
* fail(string) output string to user on failure  
  
* Test fixture is a state of the test which includes objects and variables used by many tests, prefix and postfix values  
* Objects in test fixtures declared as instance variables
* Prefix values initialized using @before and postfix using &After (reset values)  
  
**CHECK PPT EXAMPLE**  
* Data driven: Constriuctor allows multiple test values to be used to test  
* @Parameters has the collection of data values  
* @RunWith (Parameterized.class)  
* @Parameters public static Collection<Object []> parameters(){return Arrays.asList(new Object [][]{{1,1,2},{2,3,4}});
