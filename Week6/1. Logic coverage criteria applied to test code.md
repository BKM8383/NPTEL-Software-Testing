* predicates are found in decision statements  
* Variables in the prediciate that are not inputs to the program are called internal variables  
  
Issues:  
* ACC can be expensive so rewrite program to elminate many clauses in predicates  
* To find cyclomatic complexity, we work with simple predicates (predicate with 1 clause)  
* Breaking down program to change complex predicates to simple may not always work  
* Predicate transformation deals with re writing predicates so that they have 1 clause only  
* Some code segments may get repeated so not a good programming practice to split predicates into simple predicates  
* On splitting predicates to simple predicates and applying predicate coverage, CACC may not be satisfied
