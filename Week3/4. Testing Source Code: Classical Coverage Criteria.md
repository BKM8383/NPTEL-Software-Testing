# Testing Source Code: Classical Coverage Criteria  
* Data flow graph augments control flow graph with data  
* Code coverage: Statement coverage, branch coverage decision coverage, path coverage  
  * Node coverage is the same as statement coverage  
  * Edge coverage is the same as branch coverage  
  * Prime path coverage is the same as loop coverage  
  
* Cyclomatic complexity: Basis path testing, structural testing  
  * It is a software metric used to indiciate how complex a program is  
  * It represents the number of linearly independent paths in the cfg of a program  
  * A linearly independent path is any path through the program that introduces atleast one new edge that is not included in any other linearly independent paths.  
  * Basis path testing deals with testing each independent path in teh CFG  
  * Linearly independent path is a path that is not a sub path of any other path  
  * Cyclomatic complexity M=E-N+2P  
    * E:# of edges  
    * N:# of nodes  
    * P: # of connected components  
    * Cyclomatic complexity should usually be between 1 and 10  
    * 1 decision point has 1 node with 2 edges going out so cyclomatic complexity can give the number of decision points plus 1  
    * If an edge is added from the final to initial vertex, it becomes a strongly connected compnonent  
    * Cyclomatic complexity aka cyclomatic number  
    
  * **Basis path testing**: Used to test a code with respect to cyclomatic complexity  
  * TR for basis path testing is the set of linearly independent paths  
  * Basis path testing subsumes branch coverage and complete path coverage subsumes basis path testing  
    
* Decision to decision path: DD Path  
  * Path of execution between 2 decisions  
  * Chain in a graph is a path which has different start and end vertices, and all interior vertices have indegree and outdegree as 1  
  * Maximal chain is a chain that is not a part of any other  
  * DD-Path is a set of vertices that satisfies one of the following  
    * Single vertex with in degree 0 (initial)  
    * Single vertex with outdegree 0 (final)  
    * Single verted with indegree >=2 or outdegree>=2 (decision vertex)  
    * Single vertex with indrgee and outdegree 1  
    * Maximal chan of length 1
