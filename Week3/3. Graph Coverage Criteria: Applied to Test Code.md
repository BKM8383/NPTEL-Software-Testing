# Graph Coverage Criteria: Applied to Test Code  
* Function calls are represented using a call graph  
* Control flow graph: nodes are statement or basic block, edges are transfers of control   
* Basic block is a sequence of statements such that there are no branches. If first is executed then all are  
* CFGs are also annotated with branch predicates  
* Extra nodes are added to the CFG for loops
