# Data Flow Graph  
* Data is represented as variables  
* A variable is created and then used. A variable that is not declared cannot be used  
* We need to track a variable from where its defined to where it's used  
* Definition of a variable is where the value of a variable is stored in memory  
* Input, assignment, parameter passing are all examples of def  
* Use is where the value of a variable is accessed  
* du-pairs are pairs of definition and use  
* Several du pairs coiuld be there for a variable  
* def(n) is applciable for a graph and for a node n, def(n) is the variables that are declared at that node  
* def(e) is applicable for a graph and for an edge e, def(e) is the variables that are defined at that edge  
* Same applies for use(n) and use(e)  
*  Sequence of assignment statements is collapsed into 1 node  
* Parameters passed to a method are considered as def  
* iPat++ , then both def and use  
* If a variable is used in a computation or an output statement, then computation use or c use (dcu)  
* If v is used in a conditional statement, then it is a predicate use (p-use)(dpu)  
* du(li,lj,v) variable v is defined at li and used at lj  
* A definition may not reach a use  
* A path is def-clear if  is n ot given another value anywhere in the path  
* du path is a def clear path from the def of v to the use of v  
* du(ni,nj,v) are set of du paths from ni to nj for a variable v  
* du(ni,v) are the set of du paths that start at ni for a variable v  
* du path can be from def to another use, where the variable is again defined at the point where it is used
