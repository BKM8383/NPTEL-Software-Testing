# Design Integration Testing and Graph Coverage  
* Call graphs are used  
* Structural coverage criteria deals with calls over interfaces  
* Data flow coverage criteria deals with data exchange between interfaces  
  
### Structural  
* Nodes are modules so node coverage will be to call every module atleast once  
* Edges are calls so edge coverage is to execute every call once  
* Path coverage is to test a sequence of calls (for big bang)  
* No loops in call graphs so no prime paths  
   
* Class call graphs dont make sense as there wont be many calls within a classs so graphs represent inheritance and polymorphism  
* Consider objects for each of the classes since classes are not execuatble)  
* OO call coverage criteria (1 obj per class): TR contains each reachable node in the call graph of an object instantiated for each class  
* OO Object call coverage (many objs in a class): TR contains each reachable node in the call graph of every object instantiated for each class  
  
## Data flow  
* Caller: module that calls another  
* Callee: module that is called  
* Call site: node where the call occurs  
* Actual parameter: variable in the caller  
* Formal parameter: variable in the callee  
* Coupling variables: defined in one unit and used in another  
  * Parameter coupling: x could be passed in caller and y used in callee  
  * Shared data coupling: Shared variables  
  * External device coupling: access data from a file  
* Last def (before calls and returns): set of nodes that define a variable x and has a def clear path from the node to the call site  
* First use: Set of nodes that habe uses for a variable y and a def clear and use clear path from call site to the node  
  
Coupling data flow coverage criteria:  
* Coupling DU path is from last def to first use  
* All coupling def coverage: Path from every last def to atleast one first use  
* ALl coupling use coverage: Path from every last def to every first use  
* all coupling du paths coverage: Every simple path from last def to first use executed  
* Side trips are allowed  
* If a calls b ad b calls c and c uses a var in a then transitive du pairs (not needed)  
* For arrays, ref to one element in the array refers to ref to entire array  
  
* D0-178C used by aviation authority mentions coupling testing
