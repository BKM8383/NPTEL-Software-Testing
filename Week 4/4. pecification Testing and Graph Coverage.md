# Specification Testing and Graph Coverage  
* Types of design specifications:  
  * Sequencing constraint  
  * State behavior  
* precondition is something which must be true before an action can occur  
* postcondition is something which must be true after an action occurs  
* Sequencing constraints are rules that impose constraints on the order in which methods may be called  
* These are written along with design so that design can meet requirements  
* Designer should always write sequencing constraints  
* Consider CFG and see if sequencing constraints are violated  
* They can violate statically (dont run the code) or dynamically   
* In dynamic testing, sometimes a loop cannot be skipped completely so might have to enter a loop atleast once  
* One test criteria for each sequencing constraint  
* For state related sequencing constraing FSM is used
