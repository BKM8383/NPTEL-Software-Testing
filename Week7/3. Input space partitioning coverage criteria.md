 # Input space partitioning coverage criteria  
 * ** All combinations Coverage AcoC**: Consider every combination from every partion. ex: [A,B],[1,2,3],[x,y] where the values inside the partitions are blocks (A,B,1,2,3,x,y) then 2*3*2 possible combinations so 12. It generates all possible combinations so might not always be necessary  
 * **Each choice coverage**: Each value in each partition must appear in atleast one tets case. for example, [A,B], [1,2,3] then (A,1), (B,2) and 3 must also be included so it can go along with A or B. Total number of test cases is max length of any partition. It is a weak coverage criteria and might leave out important combinations  
 * **Pair wise coverage**: A value from each partition must be combined with all values from other partitions in pairs. example, 3 partitions with 2,3,2 blocks, the 2*3+2*2+3*2 pairs in total. The chosen test cases can each then cover as many number of pairs. There will be atleast max # of blocks squared values **DOUBT**  
 * ** T wise coverage**: instead of looking at a pair of values look at t values.
