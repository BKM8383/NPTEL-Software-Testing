# Software Design and Integration Testing  
* Creating graphs for design instead of code is in integration testing  
* Software design tells how a large software is split into modules  
* Modules interact wuth each other using interfaces  
* Interfaces define how control and data flow between modules  
* Modules are self contained(standalone)  
* Integration testing involves testing if the put together modules meet functionalities and if interfaces are correct  
* Integration is after unit testing  
* Types of interfaces:  
  * Procedure call interface: procedure or method in one module calls procedure/method in another module  
  * Shared memory interface: Block of memory shared between 2 modules  
  * Message passing interface: Modules prepare messages and transmit it through the interface  
* 25% of total errors are interface errors  
* Types of errors:  
  * Module functionality related: One module could call another module and assumes the other module offers some functionalities but that module may not offer those  
  * Interface related: Wrong parameter order when calling procedure in another module  
  * Inadequate error handling  
  * Initialization and other value errors  
  * Timing and performance: may have timed out early  
* Integration does not have to wait for all modules to be ready  
* Testing as and when module is ready: Not all components may be ready so extra components are neeeded. this is **Scaffolding**  
* Types of scaffolding:  
  * Test stub: Create a dummy module that substitutes actual module  
  * Test driver: replaces a component that takes care of the calling of the modules. For example, parent may call 3 modules, but if parent is not ready then use test driver  
* **5 approaches to integration testing**  
  * Incremental: As and when modules are ready, test cycle by cycle  
  * Top-down: Works with hierarchical design. Top level is decomposed, and those are further decomponsed into other modules. Terminal modules are not decomposed. Start with top model and test top model independently with 1 lower level module, then keep adding one at a time from the lower level. (**ppt diagram**) Stubs are used  
  * Bottom up: Start from modules in the lowest levels and move up and use test drivers 
  * Sandwich: Mix of top down and bottom down. Uses both of them  
  * Big bang: All undividually tested modules are put together and tested  
    
Graphs for integration testing  
* Nodes are modules, test stubs, test drivers  
* Edges are interfaces
