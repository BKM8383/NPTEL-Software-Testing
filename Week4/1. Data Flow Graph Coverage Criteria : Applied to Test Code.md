* 3 data flow coverage criterias: all defs,all uses, all du paths  
* No defs and uses at the dummy node used for the loop  
* Node which is reached on completion of the loop still has previous loop counter under def because of last increment  
* Defs only appear at nodes  
* Uses can appear at nodes or edges. They appear at edges for checking of conditions  
* List all nodes and the defs and uses at each node  
* Then list all the edges and the uses at edges  
* (1,1) not listed as it starts and ends at the same node and is not a du path. (8,8) should also not have been listed  
* Test cases to skip the loop, 1 iteration of the loop, and more than 1 iteration of the loop  
* More bugs detected using data flow coverage criteria than branch coverage criteria
