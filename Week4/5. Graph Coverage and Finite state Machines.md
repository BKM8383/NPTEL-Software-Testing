# Graph Coverage and Finite state Machines  
* UML supports FSMs  
* FSM good for control intensive application but not for data intensive  
* FSM annotated with entry actions, exit actions, actions on transitions  
* Preconditions are conditions true for a transition to be take  
* Trigger is the event that causes a transition to take place  
* Node coverage: execute every state  
* Edge coverage: every transition  
* Edge pair coverage: execute every pair of transitions  
* Data flow coverage: No defs or uses in nodes. So data flow coverage not used. Logic used instead  
* FSM not used to model, only english statements are written by designers in the specification. Testers use FSM.  
* Control flow graph is not an FSM  
* Call graphs are not FSMs  
* Values of variables need to be considered in FSMs and transitions tell how values change  
&nbsp;
* UML is unified modelling language  
* Many UML diagrams are graphs: FSM, state charts, use case  
* Graph coverage criteria can be applied  
* Nodes and edges will have defs and uses but different from CFG
