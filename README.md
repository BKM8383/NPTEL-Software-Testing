# NPTEL-Software-Testing
## Week 1   
* Introduction to software testing  
* Popular examples of faults due to lack of testing  
* Types of testing  
* Maturity levels in testing  
* Testing terminologies  
* Model based testing and criterias  
```diff
- jUnit example and terminologies
```  
  
## Week 2  
* Basics of graphs, reachability, test path,touring  
* Types of coverage criteris  
  * Structural coverage criteria  
  * Data flow coverage criteria  
* Structural coverage criteria  
  * Node coverage  
  * Edge coverage  
  * Edge pair coverage  
  * Path coverage  
    * Complete path coverage/specified path coverage    
    * Prime path coverage  
    * Complete round trip coverage/specified path coverage  
    * Simple round trip coverage  
  * Tour with side trips and detours  
  * Structural coverage criteria subsumtion  
* BFS  
* DFS (paranthesis theorem)  
* Strongly connected components  
* Algorithm for finding prime paths   
    
```diff  
- round trip coverage and why it does not subsume node coverage  
- Paranthesis theorem formula  
```  
## Week 3  
* defs and uses  
* def clear path  
* data flow coverage criteria  
  * All defs coverage  
  * All uses coverage  
  * All du paths coverage  
* CFG for code  
* Code coverage  
* Cyclomatic complexity  
* Basis path testing: testing each linearly independent path  
* DD Path and 5 conditions  
```diff  
- 3rd lecture last example why extra path in test path for prime path coverage  
- DD path 5 conditions
```
