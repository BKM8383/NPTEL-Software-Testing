# Basics of graphs  
* Graph is a tuple (V,E)  
* Graphs can be finite or infinite but we consider finite  
* Degree of vertex is number of edges on a vertex  
* Indegree is number of edges coming in and outdegree is number of edges going out  
* Special vertices can be designated that are initial and final  
* Final vertices are denoted using 2 circles  
* Initial vertex has a line coming in that is not connected to any other vertex  
* Usually only 1 initial vertex and many final  
* Initial and final vertex could be the same  
* Graphs can represent contorl flow, data flow, call graph, use case, activity  
* Graphs can have labels with edges or vertices  
* Tests must cover the graph  
  
* If statement can have a vertex with each outgoing edge representing if condition being true and false. Statements can then be written as a label for the vertices with condition for if as label for edge  
  
* Path is a sequence of vertices such that there exists an edge between every vertex in the path  
* Length of path is number of edges  
* Subpath: subsequence of vertices in a path  
* A vertex is reachable if there is a path from the initial vertex to that vertex  
* An edge (u,v) is reachable if there is a path from the initial vertex to the vertex u in the edge.  
* A subgraph is subset of vertices and edges of the graph. The subgraph is reachable if any vertex of the subgraph is reachable from the initial node of the graph.  
  
Reachability  
* DFS  
* BFS  
  
* Test path begins with initial and ends in final vertex  
* If test path can be executed by text cases then its feasible. otherwise infeasible  
  
* Test path p visits vertex v if v occurs in the path P. Test path p visits edge e if e occurs in path p.  
* Test path p tours a path q if q is a sub path of p  
* Each vertex and edge itself is a subpath so test path tours those edges and vertices  
* Many different test cases can execute the same path  
* Reachability is now in the presence of the conditions in the labels  
* Path(T) is set of tets paths executed by a set of test cases T  
* A vertex or edge or subgraph is reachable if there is a test case whose path can be executed to reach the vertex or edge or subgraph  
  
* Test Requirement: properties of test paths  
* Test criteria: rules that define test requirements(example cover all 2 branches of a switch case)  
* Satisfaction: Given TR for a critera C, set of tests T satisfies C iff for every test requirement, there is a test path that meets the test requirement  
  
* Structural coverage criteria: defined in terms of vertices and edges  
* Data flow coverage criteria: Graph must be annotated and requirements are based on annotations
