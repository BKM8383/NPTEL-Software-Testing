# Algorithms: Structural graph coverage criteria

* Undecidable to see if a criteria is feasible or not  
* TR for node coverage: all vertices in the graph  
* TR for edge coverage: all edges in the graph  
* BFS can be modified to get test paths for node and edge coverage  
  
* Edge Pair coverage: explore adjacency list of one node, and adjacency list of the successors for all vertices  
  
* Complete path coverage not feasible if there are loops  
  
* Prime path coverage: compute list of prime paths which is the TR  
  * First enumerate simple paths in increasing order of length  
  * Choose some of the simple paths as prime paths  
  * if the final node is included,include ! in the path. If it is a loop and cannot be further extended use *  
  * Repeat this till you get paths of length |V|  
    
  * Test path for prime path coverage: Start with longest prime path and extend it to the left to seem if it can be extended to the start node
