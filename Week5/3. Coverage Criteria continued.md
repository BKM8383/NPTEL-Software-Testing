# Logic coverage criteria  
* Inactive clause coverage: major clause should not affect the predicate  
* There are 4 TRs, the major clause is ci and predicate is p  
  * ci is true with p true  
  * ci is false with p true  
  * ci is true with p false  
  * ci is false with p false  
* Inactive clause coverage subsumes predicate coverage as according to the TR p is both true and false  
* Correlated ICC does not make sense since major clause does not determine predicate  
* General Incactive clause coverage: The valuse of the minor clauses may vary  
* Restricted inactive clause coverage: The values of the minor clauses must be the same for when the predicate is true and the same for when predicate is false  
* Many TRs are infeasible so ignore the coverage criteria and look at others  
* RACC and RICC are infeasible often, so use CICC or CACC instead
