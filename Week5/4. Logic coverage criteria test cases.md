* As long as a predicate is not valid or is not a contradiction, then predicate and clause coverage can be done  
* RIPR must be solved when writing test cases  
* Test cases for ACC and ICC: Make the major clause true and xor it with the major clause made false. Pc= Pc=true xor Pc=false  
* If the major clause always determines the predicate, then ICC is infeasible. If a major clause can never determine a predicate, then ACC is infeasible  
* Find expression Px for every clause x. Evaluate the expression and include in truth table to find out GACC,RACC etc
